      <description>Introduction The dataset Streams contains the global and US streams by date for 3 Grammy performance songs: Watermelon Sugar-Harry Styles, Everything I Wanted-Billie Eilish, Don’t Start Now-Dua Lipa. This dataset was acquired from a website that contains Spotify streaming data on top songs (https://kworb.net/spotify/). This interested me, because I was curious to see how the number of streams compared since each was performed at the 2021 Grammy’s.</description>

      <description>Data The dataset I chose includes information on named hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. I found this dataset interesting becuase it comes from a paper that claimed that hurricanes with female names were not taken as seriously and therefore caused more deaths and damage. The main variables include: Name, wind speed in MPH, atmospheric pressure at landfall in millibars, date of first landfall, property damage in millions of 2014 US dollars, deaths, and whether the hurricane had a male or female name.</description>
